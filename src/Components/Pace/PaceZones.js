      Zone 1: Very Easy
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 1, known as the very easy or recovery zone, is the most comfortable
      pace for running. It feels very easy, allowing for easy conversation while
      running. This zone is essential for building a strong aerobic base and
      aiding in recovery after intense workouts. It helps runners to maintain a
      steady effort without straining, making it ideal for recovery runs,
      warm-ups, and cool-downs.

      Zone 2: Comfortable
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 2, often referred to as the aerobic or comfortable zone, enhances
      aerobic capacity and endurance. Running at this pace should feel
      comfortable and sustainable for long durations. It's perfect for long runs
      and steady-state workouts, helping to build endurance and improve the
      body's ability to utilize fat as an energy source. This zone is crucial
      for developing a strong cardiovascular foundation.

      Zone 3: Moderate
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 3, also known as the tempo or moderate zone, introduces a moderately
      challenging effort. Running in this zone is often used for tempo runs,
      which are crucial for improving lactate threshold and overall stamina.
      While it requires more effort than Zone 2, it remains sustainable for
      periods ranging from 20 to 60 minutes. This zone helps runners increase
      their ability to sustain higher intensities over time.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h2' gutterBottom>
      Zone 4: Hard
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 4, known as the threshold or hard zone, involves running at a hard
      but sustainable pace. It is typically maintained for 20 to 40 minutes and
      is crucial for improving the lactate threshold. Running in Zone 4 feels
      hard, yet it is a critical component of training that helps runners
      enhance their ability to maintain high intensities. This zone boosts
      aerobic power and the capacity to sustain fast paces.

      Zone 5a: Very Hard
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 5a, the very hard zone, represents the beginning of high-intensity
      efforts. Running at this pace feels very hard and can only be sustained
      for a few minutes. It is commonly used for interval training aimed at
      boosting VO2 max, enhancing speed, and increasing power. Zone 5a is
      essential for improving overall performance through short, intense bursts
      of effort followed by recovery.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h2' gutterBottom>
      Zone 5b: Extremely Hard
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 5b, known as the extremely hard zone, involves efforts that are
      maintained for 1 to 3 minutes. It is characterized by extreme difficulty
      and is used to enhance anaerobic capacity and power. This zone focuses on
      short, intense intervals that push the body's limits, making it crucial
      for improving speed and power output. Workouts in Zone 5b require adequate
      recovery due to their taxing nature.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant='h2' gutterBottom>
      Zone 5c: Max Effort
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      Zone 5c, the max effort zone, represents the highest intensity level. This
      zone involves an all-out effort that can be sustained for less than a
      minute. It is used for sprint intervals and maximal effort training, aimed
      at improving anaerobic power and sprinting ability. Zone 5c is incredibly
      demanding and requires full recovery between efforts. This zone is
      essential for athletes looking to maximize their speed and neuromuscular
      coordination.
